#LTW PROJECT

Project description for the 2016 edition of the Web Languages and Technologies course.

OBJECTIVE

Create a web application where users can share and review restaurants. To create this application, students should:

Create a sqlite database where data about users and events is stored.
Create documents using HTML and CSS that represent the web pages of the application.
Use PHP to generate those web pages after retrieving/changing data from the database.
Use Javascript or jQuery to enhance the user experience (for example using Ajax).

REQUIREMENTS

The minimum expected requirements are the following:

* There should be two types of users: owners and reviewers.
* All users should be able to:
* Register a new account.
* Login and logout.
* Edit their profile.
* Owners should be able to:
* Add new restaurants to the database (name, description, photo, …).
* Manage their own restaurants.
* Reply to reviews.
* Reviewers should be able to:
* Search for restaurants.
* Leave a review (score + optional comment).

Students should also make sure that:

* The following technologies are all used: HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript (by means of jQuery), Ajax/JSON, PDO/SQL (using sqlite).
* The web site should be as secure as possible.
* Code should be organized and consistent.
* Frameworks are not allowed.
* Small helper libraries (e.g. displaying a gallery of pictures) are allowed.

Some suggested extra requirements:

* Ability for users to add their own photos to restaurants.
* Integration with google maps.
* Extra information about restaurants (price, category, open hours, …).
* Advanced search capabilities.
